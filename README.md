### Bonus - Devcontainer

I have added a devcontainer to use VSCode in a container with all the tools needed to work on the project. It's a good way to have a common environment for all the developers. It will install automatically the tools (java, maven, sonar-scanner, ...) needed to work on the project.

To use it, you need to install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.



## Refactor
### 游댮 Bad practices in Test :
- **Name of the tests**

  Sometimes the name doesn't have the appropriate norm or does not follow the appropriate name of other tests.

- Content of the tests

  The test can be repetitive and redundant at times, or it may perform unnecessary work.

### 游릭 Solution to refactor test:

- **Test parametrized**

  I employed the parametrized test to decrease code repetition and enhance the readability of the tests.

- **Rename methods of tests**
  To uniformize the naming of some methods, to follow the rules of the naming convention of Java, and to follow the naming norm of other methods. 

### 游댮 Bad practices in the main code :

- **Too many methods in the same class**

  The main class Yatzy contains too many methods. Some of them are too long or do not follow good name norming. The *Single responsibility principle* is not respected.

- **Too many parameters in the same method**

  Some methods have too many parameters or the parameters don't follow the good name norming.

- **Bad scoping of the methods**

  Methods don't have a uniform scope, some methods are static, and some methods are not static.
  

### 游릭 Solution to refactor the main code:

- **Split the main class Yatzy**

  I split the class Yatzy into several classes. Each class has a specific role. It's easier to read and understand the code. To split the class, I used the design pattern command. I created a class for each kind of score calculator, and I created a class to manage the score calculator. The class Yatzy is now a facade and the *Single responsibility principle* is respected.

- **Handling the incorrect dice values**

  I added a method to check if the dice values are correct. If not, it will throw an exception.

- **Reduce the number of parameters**

  I reduced the number of parameters of some methods. To do that, I created a new class *Dices* to manage the dices. I also renamed some parameters to follow the norming convention of Java.

- **Reduce the size of methods**

  I reduced the size of the methods to make them more readable and easier to understand. To do that I used IntStream and Stream API. I also renamed some methods to follow the good name norming.

### Bonus - GitHub Actions - SonarCloud

I have added GitHub Actions to run SonarCloud analysis on each push on the master branch. It will check the code quality and the code coverage of the project.
